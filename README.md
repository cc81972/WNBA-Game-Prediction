# WNBA-Game-Prediction

This is a machine learning project that utilizes the scikit-learn library to predict the outcome of game 1 for the WNBA finals. 
Using two sets of csv data, one for game locations and the other for more in-depth stats, as training data, we were able to predict that
the Las Vegas aces would win the first game of the title, which is truly what happened.
